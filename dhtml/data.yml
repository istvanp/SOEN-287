- title: Get element by ID
  jsbin: esexic/8
  desc: >
        You can retrieve a DOM Element by its ID by using `document.getElementById("id")`.
        <hr>
        <strong>Note about these slides:</strong> You will need to open your browser's console (Chrome: <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd> on Windows or <kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd> on Mac, Firefox with <a href="https://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a>: <kbd>F12</kbd>) for some slides from this point on when you see `console.log()`.
- title: Get element by tag name
  jsbin: ahokah/3
  desc: Another alternative is to retrieve by tag name (i.e. paragraphs, anchors and so on)
        using `document.getElementsByTagName("tag")`.

        
        Note that unlike `getElementById()`, `getElementsByTagName()` will return an array of elements,
        even if there is only one tag found.
- title: innerHTML property of DOM Elements
  jsbin: ojepun/7
  desc: Use `domNode.innerHTML` to either read or write new HTML to a DOM node.
- title: Accessing style attributes via the DOM
  jsbin: ukehux/5
  desc: "Use `domNode.style.property` to read or write a CSS property.
         
         For dashed properties, like `background-color`, you must convert the property name to
         lowerCamelCase: `backgroundColor`."
- title: Accessing form data via `document.forms`
  jsbin: iqikim/7
  desc:  All forms inside of a document are represented in `document.forms` as an array.
         Index 0 represents the very first `<form>` seen in the document, 1 the second, and so on.
         If the form element contained inside a form tag has a name,
         it is accessible using that name as the index or using dot notation. Otherwise it can be accessed via `document.forms[n].elements[m]`.
         Finally, to access the value of an input field, you can use the `value` property.
- title: Select boxes, checkboxes and radio buttons
  jsbin: acaheg/4
  desc: Checkboxes and radio buttons have a checked state.
  
        Select boxes have a selected state instead on the `option` tags (`options` property).
